# predictive-maintenance-factory-sensors

## Detailed Description

predictive-maintenance-factory-sensors is a iot-focused project that evaluates device telemetry and operational anomalies to improve fleet reliability and safety.  
This repository now includes a runnable baseline implementation, tests, and architecture documentation for production-oriented development.

## Problem Statement

Teams need fast, deterministic signals to prioritize work and reduce operational risk.

## Solution Overview

This project ingests runtime signals, computes a deterministic score, and emits structured results for downstream workflows.
